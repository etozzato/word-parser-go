I see so many processes we need to put in place to establish a better flow at work. Really anxious to play with this Paper thing. :)\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"I find myself doing a lot of searching for feedback because they're all in different places. Even with email, there's the tendency for the conversation to go in different directions, so I've got to sometimes read through unnecessary information to get to what I'm looking for. Also, with designs, none of these methods work well with document markup. Most of my team isn't too familiar with mockup tools in Adobe Reader, so without training, that's not an option. Plus, creating a PDF during the early stages would add extra steps to the production process.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"One everyday example would be a graphic design project. After I've gotten a scope, I'll begin with a first draft. I'll then email or text this draft to my supervisor (Pastor) for feedback. At this stage I'm needing to know if I'm on the right track or totally off. It's understood that the feedback will normally come in whatever form I've sent the draft, so that would be text or email. If I'm way off in my design, she'll call. \\n\\nAnother type of project would be document creation. I'll create the initial document/letter and then email it to my coworker and/or pastor. With these, I'll always email. I only text to let them know I've sent it. I'll usually ask them to email me back so I can have a log of sorts for my records. It's also easier for me to keep track of the changes in case I can't do it right then. The kind of feedback I'd be asking for in this project is primarily intent. What I mean is, does it properly convey what they want to say.\\n\\nOne last project type would be a video. With this, I almost always place the draft in the dropbox and send a link to several members of the team. I do this because of file size limitations with email. I'm asking for general opinion and to see if I've left anything out. I ask them to either text or email me their comments. Final or close to final viewings are usually done in person and changes are made on the spot if possible.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Yes. I've given several design projects to the volunteer designer on my team which have required my input. He was looking for either basic approval, or changes/corrections. We share a folder in the dropbox, so he would save his work and then text me asking me to take a look. I respond in kind via text with any changes or suggestions. Sometimes, I'll make some of the changes myself and then make him aware of what I've done. I do this as a teaching tool to help him understand in the future what I'm talking about.\\n\\nAnother example would be a video I've asked a team member to work on. She called me to ask me to take a look to let her know if she was on track. A few times I actually went to the room she was working in and gave verbal feedback, telling the good and the bad. Other times I used Teamviewer to view her screen from my office. I used this in conjunction with the office phone system so we can talk during the review. I either instructed her on the change, or if she had questions on how to do something, I'd take control and show her on the screen.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"I think I'm pretty good with receiving feedback. I've done this long enough to get a lot of my feelings out of the way. I still struggle, however, with giving feedback sometimes. I never want to crush the person's spirit, but at the same time, we have to have an end result. If it's a document creation/editing project, I'm usually doing this with my peers and so I feel very free in giving my opinion. When I'm in a supervisory role, however, this is when anxiety comes into play. \\n\\nThere was a time, though, several years ago when I was pretty new on staff part time... It was a very stressful few weeks and there was a whole lot going on.  I think I had stayed up most of the night trying to finish working on things. As part of the work, I had to design a masthead for a letter. Afterward, I got called in and basically told that they felt like I just threw it together. There have been few times I've been as upset as I was then. The reason was that I almost NEVER just throw anything together. I agonize (too much) over each project and I felt like if they knew anything about me, they'd know that what they were saying wasn't true. It was, in a word, insulting, but I didn't feel like I could or should retort at the time. Since that time, this person has become one of the strongest relationships in my life. But that was really tough for me.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Yes. We've got an event at the beginning of next month for which I was working on a t-shirt design. There were several revision and a specific group of people that needed to give input. However, a couple of times some other people (some team members and other church members) were in my office when I had that up on the screen. They gave their impressions verbally (both good and bad). \\\"I like the colors.\\\" \\\"I don't care for the colors.\\\" \\\"That's cool.\\\" etc. \"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"When in person, it doesn't allow me to multitask (which may not be a bad thing :) ). When using other forms, it can be very slow at times, because you're waiting on the other person to respond. Even with text there can sometime be long delays. Unless a project is really important and time sensitive, I try not to repeatedly reach out in a short period of time because I feel like there's a reason they're not responding. I do use the read notice on texts to tell whether or not they've seen my message. If it doesn't show this, then sometimes I'll follow up with a call just to make sure they look at it. For me, it's way too much emotion in the process because I hate the thought of imposing.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"I'm sure I did! lol\\n\\nDuring our weekly meetings, things are discussed and feedback is not always requested, but we're free to give it. I think I had some ideas about a particular situation that I made known to the group. I know I've done this more than once. Sometimes it's popular and conversation is triggered. Other times, it just kind of falls to the ground and we move right along :) The content is usually about how we can do something better than what we're currently doing. And in these settings it's always verbal.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Honestly, it was a little irritating. I had struggled with this project, and was just glad to get final approval from the people who were signing off on it. So when others gave their opinion, particularly the negative ones, I just felt like at this point, it really doesn't matter WHAT you think...\\n\\n(I feel bad for saying that!!)\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Yes I do. My approvals are generally confined to my main work area which is media, but sometime I do get pulled into other areas and am called on to make decisions.\\n\\nOne example would be signing off on a social media image and message.\\nAnother example would be authorizing a change in operational processes. We have a bookstore at church which falls under my supervision. So, when they want to do something differently, they would run it by me and I would give them the go ahead or give reasons for not doing it. \"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"I ran out of time!! (as you can see by this late submission)\\nI pick up my daughter from school on Fridays, so there's always a time crunch. I also got asked to do a couple of things that I had not planned on. One of which, I just couldn't do. There were several logistical decisions that needed to be made and I was just overwhelmed, so I tabled most of them. Shouldn't have done it, but I did...\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Right now, almost all of the approval is verbal. We don't really have formal documented processes for that. So, a request would come in the form of a phone call, email, text or face to face conversation. I would respond with either an immediate yes or no, or I would request more information, or I would take time to consult with my supervision before giving authorization.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"The things that I was most concerned with finishing, I did complete. (broadcast video editing)\\nI had some training time with one of our volunteers, which always encourages me because I feel like I'm empowering them to do more.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"It's relational, and we can really give and get full understanding about the situation.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"Usually, it will be discussed in one of our meeting. Sometimes though, they won't know at all unless they're directly affected. This would be from a lapse in communication. This, unfortunately, happens a little too often.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877128,\"Text\":\"People forget. I do all the time, especially when there's a lot going on, which is all the time! There's no documentation that can be referred to at a later date explaining what the approval was for and why it was given. There's also a lot of room for lapses in communication. When people don't know, they either make up stuff, or feel left out on purpose, neither of which is good for an organization. Lastly, there's no process that can be learned and adopted by future co-workers which cause bottlenecks in the flow of things.\"},{\"ResponseID\":1877147,\"Text\":\"Yes i was asked to provide feedback by my director on any issues with a project i was working on.  this project had a testing phase that missed its mark due to repeated revisions.  I was asked why it was taking so long to test and how can we make it better.  mY reply (in email) was that any issues we report on are being resolved slowly and the testers and developers are not looking for any other issues ( just what is reported on ).

He said he'll remember it and I think it'll take a few more calls like that before he nails it down which is understandable.\\n\\nWe had one exit interview as well with a tech leaving for better prospects. He asked if there was any advice I wanted to give and I told him to be more confident when asking for a raise. Short and simple. He know's his skills and abilities.

I figured that I want the honest truth when it comes to performance so I know what I can work on instead of being clueless.\\n\\nI want to say feedback is rarely unimportant as it's a good way to measure progress and further progress.

It's almost like they feel demoralized and you have to pick them back up and set a goal for them to overcome that. There was one time where we had a new tech who always caved when a customer was demanding or insistent. He easily lost control of any conversation if the other party came across more confident. I remember having lunch with him and decided to bring it up without him asking for it. I asked him if he ever noticed how he would lose control of conversations and what he honestly thought about it. No judging, just wanted to see where he came from as he was honestly a good guy. He got very quiet and said it's always been an issue throughout his life. He apologized even though he didn't do anything wrong at that point. I wasn't sure if he had any intention of making any changes or if he felt he was even capable of making such changes. I felt it was the latter. I remember encouraging him. He's a nice guy, obviously caring but he has to draw the line somewhere. I mentioned to him he's the expert on the phone, not them. Letting someone bully you on the phone isn't acceptable. Just because they are frustrated it shouldn't mean they can vent and take it out on him. He'll never last in any role in the future if that's the case. There's nothing wrong with admitting something is out of his league, just pass it along with confidence. There is no reason to sit there while someone berates you when you have done nothing wrong. They need to know that type of behavior is unacceptable and if they want a solution, they need to speak as an adult and so does he.\\n\\nAfter that lunch, I didn't notice too much of an improvement.

So lots of people! \\n\\nMost of the time I'm only requesting feedback from the people who are also working on the task with me, but, if a workflow or documentation change would result in changes in vendor time, the feedback process has to be a lot more extensive and usually involve managers. It's a laborious process sometimes. \\n\\nMost of the feedback requests are going out via email initially, but we might also meet in person to discuss the change once everyone has had a chance to look at it/consider alternatives.

Feedback on documentation/workflows - these requests come often, and they come from anyone and everyone. My coworkers, my manager, other higher up people, etc. This is probably the most frequent feedback request I receive. \\n\\n2. Feedback on an individual's work/performance - these requests come much less often from either my supervisor (the person I report to directly) or my manager (the person that person reports to). These requests come with new people joining the team (we had 4 new people join in the last three months or so) and with the addition of new people (not necessarily new hires) to tasks that I'm the point person on.

I think this is a fair point; it's something I need to work on, and receiving that feedback is hard. It's hard because yes, I agree that I can be overly critical, but it's well intentioned - I want things to be the best they can be.

I didn't provide that feedback to her though so....maybe it doesn't count. \\n\\nUnsolicited feedback. Hmm. You know, I really just don't think I do this very often. If I do though, it's not usually in terms of individuals, but it terms of workflow inefficiencies.  I actually probably provide that sort of feedback a lot.

I don't always have feedback to give, so being sort of required to give/receive two items a month can sometimes be a lot. Along the same lines, because there's a whole training and a process related to giving feedback, it can feel very regimented and not very organic. \\n\\nPersonally, I'd prefer to just have people question me/give feedback all the time openly.
